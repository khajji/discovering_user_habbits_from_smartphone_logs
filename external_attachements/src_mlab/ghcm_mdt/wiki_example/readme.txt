Here is a small tutorial on how to use LDA toolbox on a small dataset 
extracted from wikipedia.

Important files:
- explore_dataset.m: explains how to first look at the data.
- fit_dataset.m: explains how to fit the LDA model, and display/use the results
- fit_dataset_main_new.m: explains how to fit the LDA model on a main dataset
    and then infer topics proportions (theta) for a new dataset, using the 
    topic structure (phi) found on the main dataset.

For a general understanding about LDA and how it is fitted, please have a look
in the reference folder.
