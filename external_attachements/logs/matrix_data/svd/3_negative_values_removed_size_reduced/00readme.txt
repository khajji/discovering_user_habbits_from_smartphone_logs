Those results corresponds to an SVD run with a matrix where:
- the corpus has a size order bigger by 20 than the features size (features, time) (114, 5992) for user 4
- the non present values take 0, the unknown 0 and the present 1

We capture 44% of the variance with the top 5 concepts (for user 4)
