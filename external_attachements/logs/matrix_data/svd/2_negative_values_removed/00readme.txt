Those results corresponds to an SVD run with a matrix where:
- the corpus and the features are of the same order size [user 4 has 3414 features (rows) and 5992 realization (columns)]
- the non present values take 0, the unknown 0 and the present 1

-> there is no more negative values and we do not make a distinction between the absent and the unknown values
