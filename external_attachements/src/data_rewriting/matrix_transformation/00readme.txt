In this folder we write a code that creates a matrix version of the data from the categorized data.

A vector of the matrix contains all the events that co-occured together. Co-occuring time is defined in the code (for example 1hour means that we 
consider that all the events that happened in the same hour co-occurs together.

The first line of the matrix file contains the labels of the vectors dimentions. The ith label represents the label of the ith dimention.

Note that the vectors are organized in columns, which means that each column of the matrix represents a vector of evants thatco-occured together.
